### Evaluation

Clarity And Organization Of Content: This brief tutorial clearly guides the reader through using the Colorspace package in R. As I was creating the tutorial, I was selective with the content and careful of order - hoping to avoid overwhelming the reader with information overload. I also provided sufficient context to describe the package's purpose and convenience of deploying color palettes without being excessive with technical details. 

Accuracy and Correctness: The code in tutorial along with the narrative were written in a simplistic way. I tried to minimize the complexity and focus only on pertinent information needed to run the code seamlessly. The tutorial provides the correct methods of installing the package and employing it accurately. Everything should run smoothly!

Reproducibility: This tutorial is designed for complete reproducibility. The straightforward narrative and simple code make it easy to interpret the steps outlined in the Markdown. The code is provided in the tutorial with each chunk properly annotated to ensure easy comprehension of the operations being performed.

Presentation and Readability: This tutorial was formatted in R Markdown - making it easy to follow and scroll through. I attempted to be clear and concise with my directions/narrative, while still providing enough background for the reader's benefit. I edited out "fluff." I would contend this tutorial is successful in its presentation - granted Colorspace is not an overly complex package.
